# RAINBOW BOOKSTORE CLI APP

The Rainbow Bookstore CLI application simulates a visit to a bookstore. The shopper enters their name and budget when the program begins, and from there they have options to buy or return a book, see books by category or author, see the top 5 best selling books, check and update their budget, and exit.

## RAINBOW Bookstore Visit
